I am using SendGrid free option. You can use your gmail username and password. But I wanted to show what a more
production ready solution looks like. 

You can create a new gmail account for this. I created one just to send monitoring emails (for my own servers)

> Note:  If you have 2FA enabled for your gmail account, you need to create an app password

1. Log-in into Gmail with your account
2. Navigate to https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords
3. In 'select app' choose 'custom', give it an arbitrary name and press generate
4. It will give you 16 chars token.
